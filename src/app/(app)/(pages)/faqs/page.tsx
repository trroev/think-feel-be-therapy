        I am considered an out-of-network provider. I use a secure billing platform called Mentaya, which can help determine whether your plan includes any out of network benefits and whether it is possible to seek reimbursement for treatment. <a href="/client-guide">Learn more</a> about this in our client guide.

        There are many reasons some therapists do not accept insurance. For me, this decision came down to a few main reasons:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I care about protecting the confidentiality of my clients. I won't share your diagnosis with your insurance provider and we can avoid your insurance trying to dictate how often we can meet (applicable only for clients who are not using OON insurance benefits)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          You deserve agency. If working with an in-network therapist is best for you or your finances, do it! If you don't want to use your insurance, great, you shouldn't have to. Even if you have insurance, you may have a high deductible plan that doesn't offer much in the way of mental health coverage. Just remember, you have options, and I can help you figure out what makes the most sense for you.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Most of us know how convoluted and complicated working with insurances can be. It's hard enough to find a therapist let alone having to hassle with insurance to make it work. Also, insurances don't always compensate therapists well and billing insurance takes a lot of time and management. I've built my practice to offer the highest quality care to my clients and to meet my needs as a business owner.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Superbills are invoices that are submitted to your insurance provider when pursuing out-of-network benefits. These invoices include dates, service type (therapy code for insurance), length of session, payment amount, and a diagnosis code.
