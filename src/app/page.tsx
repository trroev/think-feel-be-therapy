        <h5>Change:</h5>
        <p>Change is a guarantee in life. It can be scary, invigorating, and everything in between. I hold change as a value because it is something we all need to learn to accept, adapt to, and grow with. It is an integral part of this work.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Trust:</h5>
        <p>Trust is at the core of any healthy relationship, including the relationship you have with your therapist. Weâ€™ll work to build a safe and caring relationship where you can find healing and greater life satisfaction.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Authenticity:</h5>
        <p>You are the expert on yourself. Therapy is a judgment-free space where you get to discover what living an authentic life means to you.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Acceptance:</h5>
        <p>Our motto is accept more, resist less. I accept people wherever they are in life when they show up to my door, and guide them to learn how to better accept themselves and their circumstances. Acceptance is so much more than a value. It is also a skill, a guiding principle, and a way of relating to others. </p>
